# Build a class EmailAddressParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').

#email_addresses = "john@doe.com, person@somewhere.org"
#parser = EmailAddressParser.new(email_addresses)
#parser.parse
# => ["john@doe.com", "person@somewhere.org"]
#You should be able to initialize with a list of email addresses either separated with spaces or separated with commas. 
#The parse method should, additionally, only return unique addresses.
